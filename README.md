# XtoX - The AIO Value Swapper
XtoX is a simple WPF C# app written in .NET Core and allows users to quickly and easily convert multiple datatypes with no issue.
Why does this exist? Well simply because all the HEX to ASCII converters online dont work with the 0x in front of a hex byte and that annoyed me. So I made this.

Questions/Comments/Concerns - Make an issue and I'll check it out.
